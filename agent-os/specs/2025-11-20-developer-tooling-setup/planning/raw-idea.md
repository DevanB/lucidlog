# Raw Idea

Configure comprehensive developer tooling including Laravel Pint, Larastan, Laravel DebugBar, Telescope, Rector, Ultracite (https://ultracite.ai - Biome-based frontend linter), CodeRabbit CLI, Lefthook, and automated checks on commit and PRs.

Ultracite replaces ESLint + Prettier with a single, fast, zero-configuration Biome preset for JavaScript/TypeScript/React.

This is Phase 1, item 0 from the roadmap.
